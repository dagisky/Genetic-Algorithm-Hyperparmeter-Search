### Project Motivation
One of the ways we can try to optimize hyper-parameter in machine learning algorithms is to use grid search. Grid Search algorithm searches for the optimal hyper-parameter by trying every combination step by step. Due to the sheer number of conbinations of hyper-parameters grid search is not an optimal solution.
